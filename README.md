# Corrections after first meet

Above code was "bad for SEO" and we changed first H2 by a P (paragraph).
```html
<section id="services">
    <h2>Service</h2> <!-- This line was changed to P during first Google Meet -->
    <h2>
        キレイなデザインは<br />
        当たり前のこと
    </h2>
```
However, in the mockup that title (and many others) shows the following text: "HEADING2 ENGLISH", so I suppose you preffer the old H2 but with a new **.en** class, lowering the normal H2 font-size.
