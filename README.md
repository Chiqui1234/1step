You can try a [demo](https://chiqui1234.github.io/1step/) here.

# Build

You need *Ruby* and *Ruby Gems* installed and in your OS and PATH. Then, you can execute these actions in a terminal (in this project directory):
```bash
gem install bundler jekyll
cd site
bundle exec jekyll serve # This will build the site and you can test a demo on localhost:4000
```

# Compatibility

This template is fully-compatible with older web browsers, especifically: 
* IE10 (late 2012)
* Safari 10.1 (early 2017)
* Any newer browser, except **Opera Mini** (all versions), **Samsung Internet 4** (early 2016)

# Questions and notes for next Google Meet (23/01/2021)
* Note the button swipe effect (https://codepen.io/kjbrum/pen/wBBLXx) uses JQuery library. Rub√©n needs native CSS & JS, so we will convert that code to Vanilla (Native) Javascript for straping out JQuery dependency.
* This project will get full IE11 compatibility when color codes are hard-coded and not stored in variables. This process will be complete at the very end of the development.
* All CSS files will be compiled into one large and optimized file when the development are finished. Right now, we use at least 7 separated CSS files because it's human-readable :)
* The sidebar in tablet mode is smaller than screen size, is like the sidebar's mockup was copy & pasted from smartphone mode. Do you want the sidebar from tablet like showed in the mockup or like the DEMO? (the sidebar text, buttons, etc; is bigger in the DEMO)
